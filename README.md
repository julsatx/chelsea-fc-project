# chelsea-fc-project
This will be a continuation of my Chelsea FC database project.

The front-end will be a styled page with all of the squad and coaching staff listed, with all players and staff being clickable

objects. Once you click on a player/coach, his stats and a photo wlil pop up.

i will use a third party api to gather the squad/coach data.

CRUD routes will be fully implemented:

   Either Create a new user at a login page, or Create a new squad/coach. 
   
   Update will be implemented by updating a player/coach in the DB.
   
   Read will be implemented by showing player/coaches through clickable links.
   
   Delete will either be used in deleting a user for the 'site' or by deleteing a player/coach.
